# The parity proof for packages/harness: every file moved from the Desk, diffed against the Desk's
# original, with every difference printed and named.
#
#   scripts/parity.sh <desk-checkout>
#
# <desk-checkout> is a checkout of Judgment-Pack/judgment-pack-desk (the extraction was read from
# integration/v0.13 at d9251ec). Each row of the table below is one moved file: its place in the
# package, its place in the Desk, the sha256 of its expected diff, and why it differs. A row whose
# digest and reason are "-" must be byte for byte the Desk's. A row with a reason prints its hunks
# under that reason, and its diff (the `diff -u` hunks printed below the row's header) must hash to
# the row's digest, so a hunk nobody named fails even in a file that has named ones. The run fails
# on a row marked "-" that differs, on a diff whose digest is not the row's, on a file missing from
# either side, and on a package file that is neither moved nor declared new below. Exit 0 means the
# hunks printed are the only differences. After an intended change, the failure prints the new
# digest to put in the row.
